This is a web-based tool designed to help individuals, especially those new to investing, understand the financial health of public companies by analyzing key balance sheet ratios. It provides clear, concise explanations and actionable insights to promote financial literacy.

## Features

# Key Ratios Calculated:

Current Ratio: Assesses short-term liquidity.

Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio): A more stringent liquidity test, excluding inventory.

Goodwill to Total Assets Ratio: Shows the proportion of intangible assets from acquisitions.

Ratio Status Indicators: Each ratio is assigned a status (Fragile, Robust, Antifragile) with color-coded indicators for quick comprehension.

AI-Powered Financial Summary: Utilizes the Gemini API (LLM) to generate a brief (max 80 words), easy-to-understand summary of the company's financial health, explaining what each calculated metric means in simple terms. Includes recent news headlines with publication dates.

# AI-Powered Actionable Insights: 
Provides 2-3 concise, actionable takeaways based on the overall financial ratios, helping users understand practical implications.

## How It Works
The application fetches real-time financial data using the Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API. Once the data is retrieved, it calculates the specified balance sheet ratios. For the financial summary and actionable insights, the application makes calls to the Gemini API (LLM), passing the calculated ratios and recent news (also from FMP) to generate human-readable explanations and insights tailored for a novice audience.
